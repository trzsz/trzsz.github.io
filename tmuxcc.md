# iTerm2 tmux Integration

With `iTerm2`, you donâ€™t need to remember the `tmux` commands and shortcuts. You can easily open new tabs and split panes, and restore everything after disconnecting and reconnecting.

The usage is super simple, just add `-CC` while using `tmux` in `iTerm2`.

- e.g., change `tmux` to `tmux -CC`
- e.g., change `tmux new-session -A -s xxx` to `tmux -CC new-session -A -s xxx`

Configure the following configuration in `~/.ssh/config`. After logging in with `ssh`, all windows and programs from the last time will be automatically restored. The program will also continue to run when it is accidentally disconnected:

```
Host xxxxx
    RequestTTY Yes
    RemoteCommand tmux -u -CC new-session -A -D -X -s yyyyy /bin/bash
# You can replace the above xxxxx and yyyyy with any name you like
```

## Common Shortcuts

The following shortcuts belongs to `iTerm2`, and works without `tmux`.

- `command + t` open a new tab
- `command + d` split panes left and right
- `command + shift + d` split panes up and down
- `command + [` or `command + ]` switch between panes
- `command + <-` or `command + ->` switch between tabs
- `command + shift + enter` make a pane full screen or restore it
- `command + fn + <-` scroll to the front of the current output
- `command + fn + ->` scroll to the end of the current output
- `command + k` clear all the current output
- `command + control + shift + d` detach tmux, reconnecting will restore all open windows

## Hide tmux control window

By default, `iTerm2` will display two windows after running `tmux -CC`, one of them look like this:

```
** tmux mode started **

Command Menu
----------------------------
esc    Detach cleanly.
  X    Force-quit tmux mode.
  L    Toggle logging.
  C    Run tmux command.
```

This window can be hidden by setting `iTerm2 -> Preferences... / Settings... -> General -> tmux`:

Checked `Automatically bury the tmux client session after connecting`.

## How to open new window

Choose your favorite way to open new window by setting `iTerm2 -> Preferences... / Settings... -> General -> tmux`:

Choose a item in `When attaching, restore windows as`, then try `tmux -CC` to find your favorite way.

## Hide title bar of panes

By default, `iTerm2` will show a title bar for each split panes, which looks ugly.

The title bar of panes can be hidden by setting `iTerm2 -> Preferences... / Settings... -> Appearance -> Panes`:

Unchecked `Show per-pane title bar with split panes`.

## Inactive window style
