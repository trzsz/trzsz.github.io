## Introduce

Does your favorite ssh terminal have server management feature? Does it support remembering password? Does it have a cool file transfer tool?

trzsz-ssh ( tssh ) supports selecting or searching servers configured in `~/.ssh/config`, supports vim operation habit, provides a server management solution.

trzsz-ssh ( tssh ) supports configuring server login password, solves the trouble of entering password each time ( It's recommended to use the public key to login ).

trzsz-ssh ( tssh ) supports [trzsz](https://trzsz.github.io/) ( trz / tsz ) natively, solved the issue of slow upload speeds while using `trzsz ssh` in Windows.

_On the author's MacOS, the upload speed using `trzsz ssh` is about 10 MB/s, while using `tssh` can reach over 80 MB/s._

**_[trzsz](https://trzsz.github.io/) needs to be installed on the server to use `trz / tsz` for uploading and downloading files._**

_Choose either the [Go version](https://trzsz.github.io/go) ( ‚≠ê Recommended ), [Py version](https://trzsz.github.io/), or [Js version](https://trzsz.github.io/js)._

_If trzsz is not installed on the server, you can still use `tssh`, but can't use `trz / tsz` for uploading and downloading._

## How to use

_`~/` represents the HOME directory. Please replace `~/` below with `C:\Users\your_name\` on Windows._

- Generate a key pair on the client, generally stored in `~/.ssh/`:

  - `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` generates a RSA key pair, private key `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, public key `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

- Append the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server, and set the correct permissions:

  ```sh
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

- Configure the `~/.ssh/config` file on the client, for example:

  ```
  Host alias1
      HostName 192.168.0.1
      Port 22
      User your_name
  Host alias2
      HostName 192.168.0.2
      Port 22
      User your_name
  ```

- Use `tssh` command to log in to the server, `tssh alias1` command to log in to the server corresponding to `alias1` in `~/.ssh/config`.

- Execute the `tssh` command without arguments, you can select or search the configured servers in `~/.ssh/config` to log in.

## Remember Password

- In order to be compatible with openssh, the password configuration is placed in `~/.ssh/password`.

- It's recommended to use the public key authentication. If you have to use the password authentication, it's recommended to set the permissions of `~/.ssh/password`:

  ```sh
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/password
  ```

- The following `~/.ssh/password` configuration represents the alias `test2`'s password is `123456`, and other aliases starting with `test`'s password are `111111`:

  ```
  Host test2
      Password 123456

  # ~/.ssh/config and ~/.ssh/password support wildcards, and tssh will use the first matched value.
  # Here we want test2 to use a different password from other test*, so we put test* behind test2.

  Host test*
      Password 111111
  ```

## Remember Answers

- In addition, there is a keyboard interactive authentication. The server returns some questions, and log in by providing the correct answers. Many custom one-time passwords are implemented by it.

- If the answers are fixed, `tssh` supports remember answers, also configured in `~/.ssh/password`. Most have only one question, just configure `QuestionAnswer1`. For those with multiple questions, the answer to each question can be configured by serial number, or by the hex code of the question.

- Use `tssh --debug` to log in, and the hex code of the questions will be output, so that you will know how to configure with the hex code. For example:

  ```
  Host test1
      QuestionAnswer1 TheAnswer1
  Host test2
      QuestionAnswer1 TheAnswer1
      QuestionAnswer2 TheAnswer2
      QuestionAnswer3 TheAnswer3
  Host test3
      6e616d653a20 my_name  # The `6e616d653a20` is the hex code of `name: `
      636f64653a20 my_code  # The `636f64653a20` is the hex code of `code: `
  ```
