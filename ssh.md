trzsz-ssh ( tssh ) is an ssh client designed as a drop-in replacement for the openssh client. It aims to provide complete compatibility with openssh, mirroring all its features, while also offering additional useful features not found in the openssh client.

## Why to do

- Can't remember all server aliases, `tssh` login prompt supports searching and selecting servers to log in.

- `tssh` has built-in support for [trzsz](https://trzsz.github.io/) ( trz / tsz ), no need to open a new session to transfer files.

- `tssh` supports multiple selection and batch login, and supports executing the preset remote command.

- `tssh` supports remember password, supports automated interaction, improving your login efficiency.

- Use `tssh` instead of `trzsz ssh` on Windows, which solves the issue of slow upload speed of `trz`.

## Login Prompt

- Before use, you need to configure `~/.ssh/config` (for Windows, it is `C:\Users\xxx\.ssh\config`, replace `xxx` with your username).

- For how to configure `~/.ssh/config`, please refer to the documentation of [openssh](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/openssh-client/ssh_config.5.en.html) ( `Match` section is not supported yet ).

- Running `tssh` without arguments will open the login prompt. If there are arguments except destination will also open the login prompt.

- If the destination is part of the aliases in `~/.ssh/config`, and can't completely match an alias, the login prompt will also be opened.

- If `#!! HideHost yes` is configured, or the alias contains `*` or `?` wildcard characters, it will not be displayed in the login prompt.

- `tssh` supports shortcuts, supports search, and supports multi-selection when used in `tmux`, `iTerm2`, and `Windows Terminal`, etc.

## Support trzsz

- [trzsz](https://trzsz.github.io/) needs to be installed on the server to use `trz / tsz` for uploading and downloading files. Choose either the [Go version](https://trzsz.github.io/go) ( ⭐ Recommended ), [Py version](https://trzsz.github.io/), or [Js version](https://trzsz.github.io/js).

- In the `~/.ssh/config` or `ExConfigPath` configuration file, configure `EnableDragFile` to `Yes` to enable the drag and drop to upload feature.

  ```
  Host *
    # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
    EnableDragFile Yes
  ```

- If you want to overwrite the existing files when dragging files to upload, configure `DragFileUploadCommand` to `trz -y`:

  ```
  Host xxx
    # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
    DragFileUploadCommand trz -y
  ```

- If you want to temporarily enable the drag and drop to upload feature, use `tssh --dragfile` to log in.

- In the `~/.ssh/config` or `ExConfigPath` configuration file, configure `EnableTrzsz` to `No` to disable the trzsz and zmodem feature.

  ```
  Host no_trzsz_nor_zmodem
    # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
    EnableTrzsz No
  ```

- You can use the `--upload-file` argument to specify file or directory to upload directly in the command line, and you can specify the `trz` upload command arguments and save path after the server, such as:

  ```sh
  tssh --upload-file /path/to/file1 --upload-file /path/to/dir2 xxx_server '~/.local/bin/trz -d /tmp/'
  ```

- You can use `tsz` in the command line to directly download files and directories to your local computer. You can also use the `--download-path` argument to specify the path for local saving, such as:

  ```sh
  tssh -t --client --download-path /tmp/ xxx_server 'tsz -d /path/to/file1 /path/to/dir2'
  ```

![tssh trzsz](https://trzsz.github.io/images/tssh_trzsz.gif)

## Support zmodem

- In the `~/.ssh/config` or `ExConfigPath` configuration file, configure `EnableZmodem` to `Yes` to enable the zmodem ( rz / sz ) feature.

  ```
  Host *
    # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
    EnableZmodem Yes
  ```

- If you want to use `rz` to upload when dragging files, configure `DragFileUploadCommand` to `rz`:

  ```
  Host xxx
    # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
    EnableDragFile Yes
    DragFileUploadCommand rz
  ```

- Not only the server, but also the local computer needs to install `lrzsz`. For Windows, you can download from [lrzsz-win32](https://github.com/trzsz/lrzsz-win32/releases), unzip and add to `PATH` environment, or install it as follows:

  ```
  scoop install lrzsz
  ```

  ```
  choco install lrzsz
  ```

- If you want to temporarily enable the zmodem ( rz / sz ) feature, use `tssh --zmodem` to log in.

- About the progress, the transferred and speed are not precise. It just indicating that the transfer is in progress.

- You can use the `--upload-file` argument to specify file to upload directly in the command line, and `cd` to the save path and specify the `rz` command with arguments after the server, such as:

  ```sh
  tssh --upload-file /path/to/file1 --upload-file /path/to/file2 xxx_server 'cd /tmp/ && rz -yeb'
  ```

- You can use `sz` in the command line to directly download files to your local computer. You can also use the `--download-path` argument to specify the path for local saving, such as:

  ```sh
  tssh -t --client --zmodem --download-path /tmp/ xxx_server 'sz /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2'
  ```

## Batch Login

- tssh supports selecting multiple servers in `iTerm2`( Requires [Python API](https://iterm2.com/python-api-auth.html), no need to `Allow all apps to connect` ),`tmux` and `Windows Terminal`, logging in to them in batches, and executing pre-specified commands in batches.

- Press `Space`, `x` or `Ctrl+X` to toggle select the current host. If it cann't be selected, it means that the current terminal is not supported yet. Please run `tmux` first.

- Press `a` or `Ctrl+A` to select all the hosts on the current page, `o` or `Ctrl+O` to select the opposite hosts on the current page, `d` or `l` move to next page.

- Press `p` or `Ctrl+P` will split panes for batch login, `w` or `Ctrl+W` will open new windows for batch login, `t` or `Ctrl+T` will open new tabs for batch login.

- Execute the `tssh` command without arguments, you can log in to servers in batches. And you can specify the commands to be executed in batches by `-o RemoteCommand`. And you can switch to an interactive shell after executing the specified command. `Windows Terminal` does not support semicolon `;`, you can use `|cat&&` instead. For example:

  ```sh
  tssh -t -o RemoteCommand='ping -c3 trzsz.github.io ; bash -l'
  tssh -t -o RemoteCommand="ping -c3 trzsz.github.io |cat&& bash -l"
  ```

![tssh batch](https://trzsz.github.io/images/tssh_batch.gif)

## Group Labels

- If there are a lot of servers, `GroupLabels` can be used to quickly find the target server when searching by `/`.

- After press `/` and search for a group label, press `Enter` to lock it. You can search for another group label by pressing `/` again, and press `Enter` to lock it too.

- In non-search mode, press `E` to erase the current search group labels. In search mode, press `Ctrl + E` to have the same effect.

- Supports configuring multiple group labels separated by spaces in one `GroupLabels`. Supports configuring multiple `GroupLabels`.

- Supports configuring group labels on multiple Host nodes in the form of wildcard \*, and `tssh` will summarize all the group labels.

  ```
  # The following testAA has group labels group1 group2 label3 label4 group5. Add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
  Host test*
      #!! GroupLabels group1 group2
      #!! GroupLabels label3
  Host testAA
      #!! GroupLabels label4 group5
  ```

## Automated Interaction

- Supports automated interaction feature similar to `expect`. After logging into the server, it automatically matches the server's output and then enters input accordingly.

  ```
  Host auto
      #!! ExpectCount 2  # Configures the number of automated interactions, default is 0 which means no automated interaction
      #!! ExpectTimeout 30  # Configures the timeout for automated interaction (in seconds), default is 30 seconds
      #!! ExpectPattern1 *assword  # Configures the first automated interaction match expression
      # Configures the first automated input (encrypted). It was encoded by `tssh --enc-secret`, `tssh` will send \r (enter) automatically
      #!! ExpectSendPass1 d7983b4a8ac204bd073ed04741913befd4fbf813ad405d7404cb7d779536f8b87e71106d7780b2
      #!! ExpectPattern2 hostname*$  # Configures the second automated interaction match expression
      #!! ExpectSendText2 echo tssh expect\r  # Configures the second automated input (plaintext), specify \r to send enter
      # Choose either ExpectSendPass? or ExpectSendText? for each interaction; if both are configured, ExpectSendPass? has higher priority
  ```

- Before each `ExpectPattern?` match, one or multiple optional matches can be configured as follows:

  ```
  Host case
      #!! ExpectCount 1  # Configures the number of automated interactions, default is 0 which means no automated interaction
      #!! ExpectPattern1 hostname*$  # Configures the first automated interaction match expression
      #!! ExpectSendText1 ssh xxx\r  # Configures the first automated input, can also use ExpectSendPass1 then configure with encrypted text
      #!! ExpectCaseSendText1 yes/no y\r  # Before matching ExpectPattern1, if encountering yes/no, then send y and enter
      #!! ExpectCaseSendText1 y/n yes\r   # Before matching ExpectPattern1, if encountering y/n, then send yes and enter
      #!! ExpectCaseSendPass1 token d7... # Before matching ExpectPattern1, if encountering token, then decode d7... and send
  ```

- When the server's output is matched, generate the `totp` 2FA code, and send it:

  ```
  Host totp
      #!! ExpectCount 2  # Configures the number of automated interactions, default is 0 which means no automated interaction
      #!! ExpectPattern1 token:  # Configures the first automated interaction match expression
      #!! ExpectSendTotp1 xxxxx  # Configure the secret (plain text) of totp, generally obtained by scanning the QR code
      #!! ExpectPattern2 token:  # Configures the second automated interaction match expression
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding the secret of totp with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      #!! ExpectSendEncTotp2 821fe830270201c36cd1a869876a24453014ac2f1d2d3b056f3601ce9cc9a87023
  ```

- When the server's output is matched, execute the specified command to obtain the one-time password, and send it:

  ```
  Host otp
      #!! ExpectCount 2  # Configures the number of automated interactions, default is 0 which means no automated interaction
      #!! ExpectPattern1 token:  # Configures the first automated interaction match expression
      #!! ExpectSendOtp1 oathtool --totp -b xxxxx  # Configure the command line to obtain the one-time password
      #!! ExpectPattern2 token:  # Configures the second automated interaction match expression
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `oathtool --totp -b xxxxx` with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      #!! ExpectSendEncOtp2 77b4ce85d087b39909e563efb165659b22b9ea700a537f1258bdf56ce6fdd6ea70bc7591ea5c01918537a65433133bc0bd5ed3e4
  ```

- Some servers may not support sending data continuously. For example, sending `1\r` requires a slight delay after `1` before sending `\r`. You can use `\|` to separate them.

  ```
  Host sleep
      #!! ExpectCount 2  # Configures the number of automated interactions, default is 0 which means no automated interaction
      #!! ExpectSleepMS 100  # Number of milliseconds to sleep between separate inputs, default is 100ms
      #!! ExpectPattern1 x>  # Configures the first automated interaction match expression
      #!! ExpectSendText1 1\|\r  # Configures the first automated input, send 1, sleep 100ms, send \r.
      #!! ExpectPattern2 y>  # Configures the second automated interaction match expression
      #!! ExpectSendText2 \|1\|\|\r  # Configures the second automated input, sleep 100ms, send 1, sleep 200ms, send \r.
  ```

- Some servers may not support sending password continuously. Then you need to configure `ExpectPassSleep`, which is `no` by default, and can be configured as `each` or `enter`:

  - Configuring `ExpectPassSleep each` will sleep for a short period of time for each character send, the default is 100 milliseconds, and you can configure `ExpectSleepMS` to adjust it.
  - Configuring `ExpectPassSleep enter` will only sleep for a short period of time before `\r` send, the default is 100 milliseconds, and you can configure `ExpectSleepMS` to adjust it.

- If you don’t know how to configure `ExpectPattern2`, you can first configure `ExpectCount` to `2`, then use `tssh --debug` to log in, you will see the output captured by `expect`, and you can directly copy the last part of the output to configure `ExpectPattern2`. Replacing `2` with any other number will also work.

## Remember Password

- It is recommended to use public key authentication to log in. Please refer to openssh documentation.

- If you can only log in with a password, it is recommended to at least set the permissions of the configuration file:

  ```sh
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/password ~/.ssh/config
  ```

- The passwords configured below for `test1` and `test2` are `123456`, and the passwords for other aliases starting with `test` are `111111`:

  ```
  # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, you can add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
  Host test1
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `123456` with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      #!! encPassword 756b17766f45bdc44c37f811db9990b0880318d5f00f6531b15e068ef1fde2666550

  # If configured in ~/.ssh/password, there is no need to consider whether it's compatible with openssh.
  Host test2
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `123456` with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      encPassword 051a2f0fdc7d0d40794b845967df4c2d05b5eb0f25339021dc4e02a9d7620070654b

  # ~/.ssh/config and ~/.ssh/password support wildcards, and tssh will use the first matched value.
  # Here we want test2 to use a different password from other test*, so we put test* behind test2.

  Host test*
      Password 111111  # supports plain text, but it is recommended to encrypt with `tssh --enc-secret`.
  ```

- - If `ControlMaster` multiplexing is enabled or using `Warp` terminal, you will need to use the `Automated Interaction` mentioned earlier to achieve remembering password. Please refer to the earlier `Automated Interaction` section, simply add a `Ctrl` prefix as follows:

  ```
  Host ctrl
      #!! CtrlExpectCount 1  # Configure the number of automated interactions, typically only requires entering the password once
      #!! CtrlExpectPattern1 *assword    # Configure the matching expression for the password prompt
      #!! CtrlExpectSendPass1 d7983b...  # Configure the password encoded by `tssh --enc-secret`
  ```

- Support remember `Passphrase` for private keys ( It's recommended to use `ssh-agent` ). Support configuring `Passphrase` together with `IdentityFile`. Support configuring `Passphrase` using private key filename instead of host alias. For example:

  ```
  # Configuring Passphrase together with IdentityFile. Add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
  Host test1
      IdentityFile /path/to/id_rsa
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `123456` with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      #!! encPassphrase 6f419911555b0cdc84549ae791ef69f654118d734bb4351de7e83163726ef46d176a

  # Configure the Passphrase corresponding to the private key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 in ~/.ssh/config
  # The wildcard * can be added to prevent the filename from appearing in the tssh server list.
  Host id_ed25519*
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `111111` with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      #!! encPassphrase 3a929328f2ab1be0ba3fccf29e8125f8e2dac6dab73c946605cf0bb8060b05f02a68

  # If configured in ~/.ssh/password, the wildcard * is not required and will not appear in the server list.
  Host id_rsa
      Passphrase 111111  # supports plain text, but it is recommended to encrypt with `tssh --enc-secret`.
  ```

- Still ask for password after `Remember Password`? Maybe it's `keyboard interactive authentication`, please refer to `Remember Answers` below.

## Remember Answers

- In addition, there is a keyboard interactive authentication. The server returns some questions, and log in by providing the correct answers. Many custom one-time passwords are implemented by it.

- For those with one question and a fixed answer, just configure `QuestionAnswer1`. For those with multiple questions, the answer to each question can be configured by serial number, or by the hex code of the question.

- Login with `tssh --debug`, the hex code of the questions will be output, so that you will know how to configure with the hex code. For example:

  ```
  # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
  Host test1
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `TheAnswer1` with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      encQuestionAnswer1 4f6b79d0e4e48fc56ee29c61bd19559a322cd07f7d27f2a7f33978671be1b522d549252b22ee
  Host test2
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `TheAnswer1` with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      encQuestionAnswer1 09d6936c104f7bbd62e3b4dc43d746496a368776b85d37b1ce8cecc2ace1b920af0ca5a1812b
      QuestionAnswer2 TheAnswer2  # supports plain text, but it is recommended to encrypt with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      QuestionAnswer3 TheAnswer3
  Host test3
      # The `6e616d653a20` is the hex code of `name: `, the `enc` prefix indicates that it's ciphertext.
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `my_name` with `tssh --enc-secret`.
      enc6e616d653a20 775f2523ab747384e1661aba7779011cb754b73f2e947672c7fd109607b801d70902d1
      636f64653a20 my_code  # The `636f64653a20` is the hex code of `code: `, `my_code` is plain answer.
  ```

- For `totp` 2FA code, you can configure them as follows (configure by serial number or hex code of the question):

  ```
  Host totp
      TotpSecret1 xxxxx  # Configure the secret (plain text) of totp by serial number
      totp636f64653a20 xxxxx  # Configure the secret of totp by the hex code of the question `code: ` that is `636f64653a20`
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding the secret of totp with `tssh --enc-secret`. Add the `enc` prefix for configuration.
      encTotpSecret2 8ba828bd54ff694bc8c4619f802b5bed73232e60a680bbac05ba5626269a81a00b
      enctotp636f64653a20 8ba828bd54ff694bc8c4619f802b5bed73232e60a680bbac05ba5626269a81a00b
  ```

- For one-time password that can be obtained by the command line, you can configure them as follows (configure by serial number or hex code of the question):

  ```
  Host otp
      OtpCommand1 oathtool --totp -b xxxxx  # Configure the command line to obtain the one-time password by serial number
      otp636f64653a20 oathtool --totp -b xxxxx  # Configure the command line by the hex code of the question `code: ` that is `636f64653a20`
      # The following ciphertext was generated by encoding `oathtool --totp -b xxxxx` with `tssh --enc-secret`. Add the `enc` prefix for configuration.
      encOtpCommand2 77b4ce85d087b39909e563efb165659b22b9ea700a537f1258bdf56ce6fdd6ea70bc7591ea5c01918537a65433133bc0bd5ed3e4
      encotp636f64653a20 77b4ce85d087b39909e563efb165659b22b9ea700a537f1258bdf56ce6fdd6ea70bc7591ea5c01918537a65433133bc0bd5ed3e4
  ```

- You can write a program to obtain the one-time password. Specify the `%q` argument if you want to get the question. Just output the one-time password to stdout and exit with 0, and the debugging information can be output to stderr (you can see it when running `tssh --debug`). Configuration example (the serial number represents the number of questions, generally there is only one question, just configure `OtpCommand1`):

  ```
  Host custom_otp_command
      #!! OtpCommand1 /path/to/your_own_program %q
      #!! OtpCommand2 python C:\your_python_code.py %q
  ```

- If `ControlMaster` multiplexing is enabled or using `Warp` terminal, you will need to use the `Automated Interaction` mentioned earlier to achieve remembering answers.

  ```
  Host ctrl_totp
      #!! CtrlExpectCount 1  # Configure the number of automated interactions
      #!! CtrlExpectPattern1 code:  # Configure the matching expression for the password prompt (totp 2FA)
      #!! CtrlExpectSendTotp1 xxxxx  # Configure the secret (plain text) of totp, generally obtained by scanning the QR code
      #!! CtrlExpectSendEncTotp1 622ada31cf...  # Or configure the encrypted secret of totp encoded using `tssh --enc-secret`

  Host ctrl_otp
      #!! CtrlExpectCount 1  # Configure the number of automated interactions
      #!! CtrlExpectPattern1 token:  # Configure the matching expression for the password prompt (one-time password)
      #!! CtrlExpectSendOtp1 oathtool --totp -b xxxxx  # Configure the command line to obtain the one-time password
      #!! CtrlExpectSendEncOtp1 77b4ce85d0...  # Or configure the encrypted command line encoded using `tssh --enc-secret`
  ```

## Custom Configuration

- The following custom configurations are supported in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tssh/tssh.conf` ( or `~/.tssh.conf`, `C:\Users\your_name\.tssh.conf` on Windows):

  ```
  # SSH configuration path, the default is ~/.ssh/config
  ConfigPath = ~/.ssh/config

  # Extended configuration path, the default is ~/.ssh/password
  ExConfigPath = ~/.ssh/password

  # The default path of the file dialog for trz uploading, the default is empty which opening the last path.
  DefaultUploadPath = ~/Downloads

  # The automatically save path for tsz downloading, the default is empty which poping up a folder dialog.
  DefaultDownloadPath = ~/Downloads

  # The global drag file upload command, note that the priority configured in ~/.ssh/config is higher.
  DragFileUploadCommand = trz -y

  # The trzsz progress bar will gradient from the first color to the second color. Don't include `#`.
  ProgressColorPair = B14FFF 00FFA3

  # When searching and selecting servers with tssh, the theme and colors.
  PromptThemeLayout = simple
  PromptThemeColors = {"active_host": "magenta|bold", "inactive_host": "magenta"}

  # When searching and selecting servers with tssh, the number of records displayed on each page, the default is 10.
  PromptPageSize = 10

  # When searching and selecting servers with tssh, default is normal mode similar to vim. Configure to search mode as follows:
  PromptDefaultMode = search

  # When searching and selecting servers with tssh, the items displayed in details. The default is as follows:
  PromptDetailItems = Alias Host Port User GroupLabels IdentityFile ProxyCommand ProxyJump RemoteCommand

  # When searching and selecting servers with tssh, you can customize the cursor and selected icon:
  PromptCursorIcon = 🧨
  PromptSelectedIcon = 🍺

  # Auto set terminal title after login. It will not be reset after exiting. Please set PROMPT_COMMAND in local shell.
  SetTerminalTitle = Yes
  ```

## Comments of Config

- The comments in the `tssh` configuration are basically the same as `openssh`, with some additional extended support, see the following table for details:

  | Comments              |   openssh    |     tssh      |
  | :-------------------- | :----------: | :-----------: |
  | Starting with `#`     | Is a comment | Is a comment  |
  | Starting with `#!!`   | Is a comment | Not a comment |
  | `Key Value # Comment` |  It depends  | Is a comment  |
  | `Key=Value # Comment` |  It depends  | Not a comment |

- Configuration starting with `#` are always considered by `openssh` to be a comment; `tssh` considers configuration starting with `#!!` not to be a comment, and other configurations starting with `#` are comments.

- `Key Value # Comment` configuration (without `=` sign), `openssh` considers the content after `#` to be a comment in some cases, and considers it not to be a comment in some other cases; `tssh` always considers the content after `#` to be a comment.

- `Key=Value # Comment` configuration (with `=` sign), `openssh` considers the content after `#` to be a comment in some cases, and considers it not to be a comment in some other cases; `tssh` always considers the content after `#` not to be a comment.

## Clipboard Integration

- In the `~/.ssh/config` or `ExConfigPath` configuration file, configure `EnableOSC52` to `Yes` to enable the clipboard integration feature.

  ```
  Host *
    # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
    EnableOSC52 Yes
  ```

- Clipboard integration allows remote servers to write to the local clipboard via OSC52 sequences.

- On Linux, clipboard integration requires `xclip` or `xsel` command to be installed.

## Other Features

- Use `-f` to run in the background, you can add `--reconnect`, it will automatically reconnect when the background process exits.

- Run `tssh --enc-secret`, enter the password or answer, and you can get the ciphertext for configuration (the encryption result for the same password is different each time):

  - The `remember password` and `remember answer` mentioned above can be configured as ciphertext by adding `enc` prefix to prevent screen snooping.
  - If the password contains special characters such as `#`, you have to configure it with ciphertext.

  ```
  Host server2
    # If configured in ~/.ssh/config, add `#!!` prefix to be compatible with openssh.
    encPassword de88c4dbdc95d85303682734e2397c4d8dd29bfff09ec53580f31dd40291fc8c7755
    encQuestionAnswer1 93956f6e7e9f2aef3af7d6a61f7046dddf14aa4bbd9845dbb836fe3782b62ac0d89f
  ```

- Run `tssh --new-host` to easily add SSH configuration in the TUI interface, and you can log in immediately after completion.

- Run `tssh --install-trzsz` to install [trzsz](https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-go) to the server automatically.

  - It is installed to the `~/.local/bin/` directory by default. You can specify the installation directory through `--install-path /path/to/install`.
  - If the `--install-path` installation directory contains `~/`, single quotes must be added, such as `--install-path '~/path'`.
  - If obtaining the latest version of `trzsz` fails, you can specify it through `--trzsz-version x.x.x`.
  - If downloading the `trzsz` installation package fails, you can download and specify it through `--trzsz-bin-path /path/to/trzsz.tar.gz`.
  - Note: `--install-trzsz` does not support Windows server, and does not support jump server (unless using `ProxyJump`).

- About changing the terminal title, it can be achieved without `tssh`. It only needs to be configured in the server's shell configuration file (such as `~/.bashrc`):

  ```sh
  # Set fixed server title
  PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;Fixed server title\007"'

  # Dynamically changing title based on environment variables
  PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD}\007"'
  ```

  - If `SetTerminalTitle = Yes` is set in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tssh/tssh.conf` ( or `~/.tssh.conf` ), the terminal title is automatically set after login, but `PROMPT_COMMAND` on the server overrides the title set by `tssh`.
  - `tssh` does not reset to the original title after exiting, you need to set `PROMPT_COMMAND` in the local shell so that it overrides the title set by `tssh`.

- DNS SRV: Say you have a home network with multiple hosts, but you only have one external IP address. Set up SRV records as follows, and make similar configurations in `~/.ssh/config`:

  ```sh
  $ dig +short _ssh._tcp.myhost.mydomain.com SRV
  1 1 22029 gateway.mydomain.com.
  ```

  ```
  Host xxx
    #!! DnsSrvName myhost.mydomain.com
  ```

## UDP Mode

- Install [tsshd](https://github.com/trzsz/tsshd) on the server, use `tssh --udp xxx` to login to the server, or configure as follows to omit `--udp`:

  ```
  Host xxx
      #!! UdpMode yes
      #!! TsshdPath ~/go/bin/tsshd
      #!! UdpPort 61000-62000
      #!! UdpAliveTimeout 86400
  ```

- The `tssh` plays the role of `ssh` on the client side, and the `tsshd` plays the role of `sshd` on the server side.

- The `tssh` will first login to the server normally as an ssh client, and then run a new `tsshd` process on the server.

- The `tsshd` process listens on a random udp port between 61000 and 62000 (can be customized by `UdpPort`), and sends its port number and a secret key back to the `tssh` process over the ssh channel. The ssh connection is then shut down, and the `tssh` process communicates with the `tsshd` process over udp.

- The `tsshd` process will exit if the network is disconnected for more than 24 hours by default, and no longer support reconnection. This can be adjusted by modifying the configuration `UdpAliveTimeout` in seconds.

- The `tsshd` supports `QUIC` protocol and `KCP` protocol (the default is `QUIC`), which can be specified on the command line (such as `-oUdpMode=KCP`), or configured as follows:

  ```
  Host xxx
      #!! UdpMode KCP
  ```

## Trouble shooting

- In the Warp terminal, the features like blocks requires renaming `tssh` to `ssh`. It is recommended to create a soft link (friendly for updates):

  ```
  sudo ln -sv $(which tssh) /usr/local/bin/ssh
  ```

  - After the soft link, `ssh -V` should output `trzsz ssh` plus the version number. If not, it means that the soft link is unsuccessful, or `openssh` has a higher priority in `PATH`, and you need to soft link to another path or adjust the priority of `PATH`.

  - In order to make `tssh` search login also support the blocks feature, you need to create a `tssh` function in `~/.bash_profile` ( bash ) or `~/.zshrc` ( zsh ):

    ```sh
    tssh() {
        if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
            ssh FAKE_DEST_IN_WARP
        else
            ssh "$@"
        fi
    }
    ```

  - The `--dragfile` argument may disable the Warp features, please refer to the previous section to configure `EnableDragFile` to enable the drag and drop to upload feature.

  - After dragging files and directories into the Warp terminal, the upload may not be triggered immediately. You need to press the `Enter` key once to make it upload.

- If you are using Windows7 or an older version of Windows10, and getting an error `enable virtual terminal failed`.

  - Try using `tssh` in [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) or [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash).

  - Since `v0.1.21`, the default Windows version no longer supports Windows7, you need to download the version with the `win7` keyword in [Releases](https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-ssh/releases) to use.

- If the `tssh` specific configuration items are configured in `~/.ssh/config`, and openssh report an error `Bad configuration option`.

  - You can add `#!!` prefix to the items, openssh will treat it as a comment, while `tssh` will treat it as one of the valid configurations.
